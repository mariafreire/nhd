            <p>The abolitionist movement served to spark change throughout the entire country. This movement has notable and courageous figures such as Harriet Tubman and Fredrick Douglass who led the revolution and fought to free enslaved people. This fight for freedom did not come without a reaction from the Confederacy, however. This friction between the Southern and Northern states started America's Civil War. In the end, the Union States of America emerged victorious and made great reforms to truly unite the people of America.</p>
